# Classes-Structures

Very simple example for Classes and Structres (Swift 4.1)
 
 Theory:
 
 + Classes
    * Classes are reference types (passed around document as reference to original)
    * Classes must be initilized
    * Classes can have sub-classes (inheritance)
 
 + Structres
    * Structres are value types (passed around document as copy's)
    * If sub-classing is not neccesary better use Structures
